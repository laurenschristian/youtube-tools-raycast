### Compression Options

Compression helps reduce file sizes while maintaining good quality:

- **Medium Compression (Balanced)**: CRF 23 - Good balance of quality and file size
- **High Compression (Smaller Files)**: CRF 28 - Smaller files with acceptable quality
- **Custom CRF Value**: Choose your own CRF value (18-30)

#### CRF (Constant Rate Factor) Guide
- **Lower CRF = Better Quality, Larger Files**
- **Higher CRF = Lower Quality, Smaller Files**
- CRF 18: Visually lossless (very large files)
- CRF 23: High quality (recommended default)
- CRF 28: Medium quality (good for storage savings)

**Note**: Compression will take additional processing time but can significantly reduce file sizes, especially for high-resolution videos.

### File Size Estimation

The extension automatically estimates file sizes based on:
- Video duration and quality settings
- Compression level selected
- Audio quality (for audio downloads)

Estimations are approximate and may vary depending on video content complexity.
